Project uses Food2Fork API to fetch recipes and you can search for recipe based on ingredients or there name. I have also added feature to load more recipe while scrolling to bottom. One can view a maximum of 90 recipes.

## Project Purpose:

This project was built to practice my ReactJS Skill.

## Tools and Skills Used

2. React Router
3. Ant Design
4. Responsive and Mobile friendly design(pure css)
5. react-infinite-scroll-component (load more recipes while scrolling to bottom)

## How to Load the App

You can run a hosted version of the app at [https://recipe-search-app.netlify.com/](https://recipe-search-app.netlify.com/)

The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app

```
git clone https://github.com/Akash187/recipe-search-app.git
npm install
```

Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with

```
npm start
```

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser
